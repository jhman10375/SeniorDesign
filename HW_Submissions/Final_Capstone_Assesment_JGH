# Final Capstone Assesment - Jordan Herman

Throughout the last two semesters I worked on college sports plus’ to design a user interface and user experience to 
enhance the game play and informational experience of college sports plus. I believe I significantly grew from where 
the project began as I had never built a complex compounded system like a multi-device draft as well as designed an 
architecture to cater to 4 different entity types (and expandable). Specifically, I built the entire client with angular, 
implemented a websocket draft system to the client and server, and connected authentication systems, storage, and 
hosting with firebase and cloudflare. I learned how to design form component such as a custom dropdown selector, 
integration of websockets in an angular application and multi device communication, web-routing, authentication and 
security protocols for routing, etc. 

My successes including a working application that in practice worked successfully on computers and mobile devices while 
catering the specific device. I was also successful in creating an intuitive draft, loading screen, login process, and 
presenting information in a simple but effective manner. Building the draft was my largest challenge. The draft required 
a new approach to client-side development than my previous experiences or knowledge had imagined, and I initially built 
the draft without any idea of how to handle the asynchronous task of the draft while giving users a synchronous experience. 
After building the draft without websockets and realizing I would need a better approach, I redesigned the draft from 
the backside of the application using websockets on the client and server and adding a login screen to create a similar 
experience to that of a chat room. While standard http protocols would suffice for this type of a task, websockets are 
more direct requests and have less baggage which would help create better response times and this allowed data to be 
stored in a reusable object on the server instead of a database further mitigating work required.

Simply put, Juan Alvarado and I built a full stack web application for web/mobile devices offering a fantasy sports game 
for college sports and an AI model to provide predictions for athlete success As a group we hosted our client and server 
publicly and created a new fantasy sports game for college sports including football, men’s basketball, baseball, and men’s 
soccer. Working with a team is always an exciting opportunity to learn how to collaborate and communicate with a shared goal. 
For this project specifically, I learned how to work on a project at times with different time zones and in such a small 
team setting with ambitious goal. I think as partners we were successful; we divided the work evenly and were able to 
communicate well to get tasks done and ask for help when needed.

I think overall we split the work 50/50 and did a really good job on collaborating to complete anything in between. 
Overall, in a successful partnership I’d say both partners deserve recognition and overall, with the successful initial 
launch of a full stack application with a net cost of less than $3, we did something right.
