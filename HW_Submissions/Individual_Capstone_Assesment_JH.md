# Individual Capstone Assesment - Jordan Herman

My name is Jordan Herman, and I am working on College Sports+, a collegiate fantasy-like
sports application. We intend to create a web-application built for cross-platform use and
will use multiple APIs and technologies to host, store, and serve the application. As the
client-side developer, I am responsible for the UI/UX of the application and will be tasked
with creating the front end, implementing an authentication system, and working with a
database to properly store and access a user’s data. My partner will be working on the
backend of the application to properly handle data served from our database and a public
sports API. Handling this data will involve creating an AI model to create player predictions
and properly serve data between the client and database. By the end of the project, we
intend to have a client-side application populating with real data allowing a user to select a
team of players across the NCAA and play our game with their friends.

Academically speaking, I am prepared for this project with the course work completed in
Software Test & QA EECE-5132, Software Engineering EECE-3093C, Web Design 1 AMEC-
2050C, and Engineering Data Structures EECE-2080C. Software Test & QA helped provide a
foundation on testing conceptually which I will be able to utilize when testing and writing
tests. Software Engineering provided an opportunity to learn about project management for
software projects and rapid prototyping and development which will be essential for the
quick turnaround of April 2024. Web Design 1 helped teach basic web development skills
in html and css and will be useful for the frontend development tasks and web design
requirements of this project. Engineering Data Structures helped teach a variety of data
structures that will help when writing various programs to traverse large data sets in this
project including player and game data. Additional course work completed has helped
provide foundations for data traversal and manipulation which will be instrumental in
delivering a product that can scale to its user’s needs and the data being accessed.
My first and second co-ops were with BMW Group as a Global Digital Solutions Co-Op and
Full-Stack Developer Co-Op where I worked on a full-stack development team with a sole
purpose to build small applications for a variety of use cases across several automotive
manufacturing plants across the world. My Specific role included project management,
UI/UX design, software development in Angular, and other related tasks. This role gave me
the basics in Angular which helped me learn modern framework web-application
development best practices. My Third, Fourth, and Fifth Co-Ops were completed with
London Computer Systems as a Software Developer Co-Op apart of multiple teams
working with Angular, .Net, and Angular with Ionic. In this role, I was responsible for client-
side development of new features, bug fixes, and minor investigations in Angular, Ionic, and
Blazor. This combined experience has given me the tools I need to successfully complete a
software project and write good code focused on the future.

My partner and I started playing in a Fantasy Football League in August 2022 based on their
enjoyment of the game and my competitive spirit, but I was always a college athletics fan,
and my partner also enjoyed college sports. With this combined passion for athletics and
acknowledging the gap between professional and collegiate athletics, we realized we
wanted to create a new fan experience that would build buy in for players across the
college landscape, bring in new users who only enjoy college athletics, and highlight less
commonly known players and teams. Having five co-ops completed in web-application
development and numerous side projects in production, I was immediately excited about a
new opportunity to get engaged with college athletics and the fan experience. In a diaerent
side project, I created a custom scheduling solution to make my job easier and schedule
access easier, taking my experience from this project, I am excited to enter a new
landscape with new goals, designs, and features. I am also excited to incorporate my
experience with component-based web development and scalar-abstractions for near-
future-proof code and eaicient features. Lastly, I enjoy a challenge and love the idea of
creating something new in very densely populated market.

My Partner and I are excited to begin working towards our end goal of a new fantasy-like
college athletics web application by first designing the game. We will create a model to
accurately create point estimates for each player considering physical attributes,
conferences, schedules, and historic data. The data will then be used to help users actively
create a team and provide scores for the game which will all be visualized in a web-
application. Working on a team of two, we have agreed to split the work based on areas of
expertise and to collaborate on ideas and items as needed. My personal expectation is to
create a working user interface accessible via browser on any platform and displaying
interactive data for the purpose of the application. Having 5 co-ops and 3 years of personal
projects worth of experience in the area I am focusing on in this project, I do believe that a
good-job and a bad-job are easily definable from work completed, similar to that of a blank
or a full canvas painting. My partner and I have agreed to create a Kanban board using a
similar application to Jira and we will monitor our progress and completion through this
project management tool.
