## Justification of Hours
- _Jordan H._ <br>

	In the first semester, most of the effort was put into building up the FastAPI server with every API endpoint needed for CS+ to work. For football and basketball, two python libraries, CFBD and cbbpy, were used to ease data scraping. However, for soccer and baseball, an in-house web-scrapper needed to be built with BeatifulSoup and Selenium. In total, 60+ API endpoints were created, each providing the front-end of the application with different data which is crucial for the user experience. <br>
	In the second semester, for the training of the AI models, relevant statistics were collected for every game in the 2024 season, for every player in every team listed in the NCAA website. All-in-all, 188,636 data points were collected for football, 188,973 for basketball, 32,601 for baseball, and 17,499 for soccer. With every sport considered, the data collection process alone took between 75 to 100 processing hours. This is without even considering the hours taken to refine the backend API and to spin up an AWS EC2 instance and properly set up Nginx for the Expo demo. The whole data collected has been collected as a CSV, but not uploaded to the GitHub for privacy reasons, however it remains available at request.
