# Final Capstone Assessment - Juan Alvarado
           	
            
For this project, I was in charge of  the backend for CS+. This included the sever-side API, as well as data collection and gathering and the AI prediction models. My responsibilities include getting all of the team names, team schedules, player names, player statistics per game and per season, and player predictions, for every player and team for all four sports. All of the Python FastAPI infrastructure was built by me (with the exception of the draft web sockets), and all of the AI functionality was built by me as well, with all of the data collected, scraped, and stored by me as well. For Expo, I was also in charge of setting up the public-facing server by setting up an EC2 instance to run the FastAPI backend server and to configure Nginx so the server could work properly.

I would say that this project definitely helped me build and apply my skills, especially when it came to developing and deploying AI models. While I had had to build many AI models for different classes, this was the first time tackling a problem outside of a strict ‘classroom’ setting. It was also my first time setting up a front-facing server for a FastAPI application. Although I had used FastAPI during my co-ops, I was never in charge of hosting the actual API so it was accessible to the front-end, but thankfully with our advisor’s guidance I was able to set up an EC2 instance within an AWS cloud-room. I would say the best successes from this project were: getting all the data APIs working for every sport, so the front-end could easily get all team and player information easily, and creating the AI models. The biggest obstacles were setting up the web-scrapers for baseball and soccer, and gathering the data to train said AI models.
